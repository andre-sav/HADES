# UX/UI Audit — HADES Lead Pipeline

**Date:** 2026-02-11 (Session 6)
**Method:** Visual inspection of all 6 pages + home via Chrome browser automation
**Baseline:** Session 5 CSS theme ("Mission Control" aesthetic) applied but uncommitted

---

## Overall Impression

The dark theme foundation is solid — deep backgrounds, card elevation, gradient primary button. But the execution is uneven: the theme coexists with unstyled Streamlit defaults in charts, tables, and secondary buttons, creating visual friction. Several pages have empty-state problems where 70%+ of the viewport is dead space.

---

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### 1. Metric Cards: White Islands on a Dark Sea
The white-background metric cards (home, usage, summary) are the most visually jarring element. They read as unstyled Streamlit defaults dropped into a carefully themed dark UI. They need dark card backgrounds with the gradient accent line from the CSS spec.

**Affected pages:** Home, Usage Dashboard, Executive Summary

### 2. Charts Ignore the Theme
The Executive Summary bar chart renders with a light gray background and default Altair/Vega-Lite styling. It looks like a screenshot pasted from a different app.

**Fix:** Transparent chart background, dark gridlines, theme-consistent colors (indigo/cyan instead of default purple/blue).

### 3. Tables Are Unstyled
All dataframe tables use Streamlit defaults — no row hover, no alternating row tones, no inline data visualization (score bars, status pills). The Recent Runs table on Home and Export is purely functional with no visual polish.

**Proposed:** Alternating row backgrounds, hover highlight, monospace numbers, status column with color-coded pills ("Exported" = green, "Not exported" = muted).

### 4. Empty State Wastelands
Multiple pages show minimal content with 60-80% empty viewport:
- **CSV Export** — "No leads staged" with two text links and a small table
- **Usage Dashboard** — 3 cards and a tiny progress bar
- **Geography Workflow** (Step 1) — Just an operator dropdown

**Proposed:** Contextual guidance (what to do next), illustration/icon, or secondary content (recent activity, tips).

### 5. Button Hierarchy Inconsistent
- Primary "Search Companies" gets the indigo→cyan gradient
- "Refresh" on Usage/Summary is plain white/outline — should be secondary style
- "Delete" on Operators is flat red — too prominent, invites accidental clicks
- "+ Add operator" is dark/subtle — appropriate

**Proposed:** 3-tier system: Primary (gradient), Secondary (outline/border), Destructive (red outline, not filled, with confirmation).

### 6. Font Loading Uncertain
Session 5 added Urbanist + IBM Plex Mono via `<link>` tag. From screenshots, text *appears* to be in a sans-serif that could be Urbanist, but the monospace treatment on data values (metric numbers) isn't clearly visible — the numbers in metric cards look like the same font as labels.

**Verify:** Inspect computed font-family in DevTools to confirm fonts are loading.

### 7. Sidebar Lacks Icons
Sidebar nav items are plain text. Adding page-specific icons would improve scannability and reinforce the "Mission Control" aesthetic. Streamlit supports emoji or icon prefixes in page config.

### 8. Color Palette Drift
- Metric card accent: none visible (should be gradient top border)
- Progress bar: green (Usage) — clashes with indigo/cyan palette
- Chart bars: default purple — not in the design system
- Credit badge: green (Connected), red outline (445 left) — functional but ad-hoc

**Proposed:** Codify palette: indigo (primary), cyan (accent), amber (warning), red (danger), emerald (success). Apply consistently.

### 9. No Loading/Transition States
Page transitions show a blank dark screen (observed on CSV Export). No skeleton loaders, no spinners, no fade-in. The session 5 CSS includes a 300ms fade-in-up animation, but it may not be triggering on page navigations.

### 10. Information Density Imbalance
- **Operators page** is dense (3036 records, scrollable list) — good
- **Home page** is moderately dense (4 cards + table + links) — acceptable
- **Usage, Export, Summary** are sparse — feel like placeholder pages

## Page-by-Page Findings

### Home (app.py)
| Finding | Severity | Proposal |
|---------|----------|----------|
| White metric cards | High | Dark cards with gradient accent line |
| Quick-links (Intent/Geo/Export) are plain text with emoji | Medium | Card-style links with icon, description, last-run timestamp |
| Recent runs table has no status styling | Medium | Color-coded status pills, row hover |
| "Connected" badge is small and easy to miss | Low | Larger status indicator or integrate into header |
| Large empty space below table | Medium | Add more dashboard content or reduce page height |

### Intent Workflow
| Finding | Severity | Proposal |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Step indicator looks good | -- | Keep |
| Credit badge (top-right) is small | Low | Inline with header or make more prominent |
| "Step 1: Search Intent Companies" sub-label is very faint | Medium | Slightly brighter or remove (redundant with step indicator) |
| Filters expander is collapsed by default — good | -- | Keep |
| Large empty space below form | Low | Acceptable — will fill when results appear |
| Autopilot mode description box is nicely styled | -- | Keep |

### Geography Workflow
| Finding | Severity | Proposal |
|---------|----------|----------|
| 4-step indicator works well | -- | Keep |
| Step 1 is very sparse (just operator dropdown) | Medium | Add operator preview card (name, ZIP, territory info) after selection |
| "0 credits / This week" badge is plain | Low | Match Intent's pill style |

### Operators
| Finding | Severity | Proposal |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Red Delete buttons are too prominent | High | Red outline/text only, require confirmation |
| Last visible card's Edit/Delete buttons appear broken (grey/invisible) | High | Rendering bug — investigate |
| Phone number formatting inconsistent (some formatted, some raw digits) | Medium | Normalize display format |
| No pagination indicator (3036 operators) | Medium | Add "Showing 1-20 of 3036" with page controls |
| Operator cards lack visual grouping (no card border/background) | Low | Subtle card background or left-border accent |
| "Sync from Zoho CRM" dropdown feels disconnected from the list | Low | Move to sidebar or make it an action button |

### CSV Export
| Finding | Severity | Proposal |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Empty state is barren | High | Add illustration, clearer CTA buttons (not just text links), show pipeline status |
| Recent runs table duplicates home page | Low | Differentiate — add export-specific columns or filter |
| "Run Intent Search" / "Run Geography Search" are plain text | Medium | Make them proper buttons or card-style links |

### Usage Dashboard

|---------|----------|----------|
| White metric cards | High | Dark cards (same fix as home) |
| Progress bar is tiny and uses off-palette green | Medium | Larger bar, indigo/cyan gradient fill |

### Executive Summary

## Priority Implementation Order

### P0 — Visual Consistency (fixes the "two apps in one" feel)
1. Dark metric cards with gradient accent line (affects 3 pages)
2. Chart theme override — transparent background, dark gridlines, palette colors
3. Button hierarchy — primary/secondary/destructive styles

### P1 — Information Density
4. Home page: card-style quick-links, richer recent-runs table
5. Usage Dashboard: credit burn sparkline, larger progress bar
6. Export empty state: proper CTA buttons, pipeline status summary

### P2 — Polish
7. Table styling: row hover, alternating tones, status pills
8. Sidebar icons
9. Operators: fix ghost buttons, pagination indicator, Delete confirmation
10. Loading/transition states: verify fade-in animation, add skeleton loaders

### P3 — Enhancement
11. Executive Summary chart improvements (dual-color bars, dark theme)
12. Geography Step 1: operator preview card
13. Codified color palette as CSS custom properties
14. Empty-state illustrations or contextual guidance
