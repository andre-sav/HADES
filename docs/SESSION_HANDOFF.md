## Session Summary (2026-02-23, Session 36)

### What Was Done

Investigated previous session's stalled Chrome MCP test of the Intent Workflow. Diagnosed root cause and fixed a UX dead-state bug.

**Investigation findings:**
- Prior session (post-35) implemented intent yield expansion (commit d551631): removed invalid `excludeOrgExportedContacts` param (400 fix), expanded topics to 4, bumped page_size 25→100
- That session then tried to live-test in Chrome, hit context compaction, and stalled for 10+ minutes ("Noodling")
- All code from that session was already committed — no work was lost

**CLI pipeline verification:**
- Intent Search API: Working (100 results returned)
- `excludeOrgExportedContacts` 400 error: Confirmed fixed
- Contact Search API: Working (no 400 errors)
- Scoring: Working correctly — but all 100 current "Vending Machines" intent signals are stale (>14 days), so 0 survive freshness scoring

**UX bug found and fixed — Intent Workflow dead state:**
- **Root cause**: When autopilot search returns results but 0 survive freshness scoring, `intent_companies_confirmed` was set True while `intent_selected_companies` was empty. Stepper advanced to Step 2 but no content rendered — dead state with no user feedback.
- **Fix 1**: `get_current_step()` — changed autopilot condition from `intent_companies` (raw results) to `intent_selected_companies` (actual selections). Stepper no longer falsely advances.
- **Fix 2**: Auto-select guard — `intent_companies_confirmed` only set True when `auto_selected` is non-empty. Both cache-hit and API-call paths fixed.
- **Fix 3**: New warning message — "All N intent results are stale (>14 days old)" when raw results exist but 0 survive scoring.

**Also produced:** Comprehensive test self-prompt for full HADES system testing (all pages, workflows, scoring, data quality, UX, performance).

### Test Count
704 tests passing (unchanged — UX-only fix, no new test surface)

### Key Files Modified
```
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py  — 3 fixes: stepper logic, auto-select guard, stale warning message
```

### Uncommitted Changes
`pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py` — the 3 UX fixes described above (17 insertions, 3 deletions). Ready to commit.

Untracked (pre-existing, not from this session): `docs/ux-review-session26.md`, `ux-review/`

### Known Issues
- Chrome MCP extension is unreliable — disconnects frequently during browser automation, making live UI testing difficult
- All current "Vending Machines" High intent signals are stale (>14 days). The expanded topics (Coffee Services, Water Coolers) in automation config should help yield, but only run via the daily cron job
- HADES-iic (Zoho CRM dedup) still needs user clarification on CRM workflow

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Commit the UX fix** — `pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py` dead-state fix (ready to commit)
2. **Run the comprehensive test self-prompt** — generated this session, covers all pages/workflows/scoring/data quality
3. **HADES-iic** [P4] — Zoho CRM dedup at export (needs user input on CRM workflow)

### Beads Status
- **Open:** HADES-iic (P4, Zoho CRM dedup)
- **All P0-P3 beads closed.** Remaining: 1 P4
- **Total:** 36 closed, 1 open, 0 in progress

## Session Summary (2026-02-23, Session 35)

### What Was Done

Recovered from a system crash that lost all uncommitted code from a prior session attempt. Re-implemented everything from scratch. Closed 9 beads total:

**Batch 1 — 5 UX polish beads:**
1. **HADES-v3y** [P3] — WCAG contrast fix (#5c6370→#8b95a5, ratio 3.8:1→5.2:1), CSS typo `font_weight`→`font-weight`, sidebar icon comment
2. **HADES-3p4** [P3] — Removed redundant page_link CTAs from CSV Export
3. **HADES-t4g** [P3] — Missing business name → muted italic "No business name"
4. **HADES-2jp** [P3] — Removed redundant large operator count from header
5. **HADES-ctq** [P3] — Replaced styled_table with sortable st.dataframe for SIC codes

**Batch 2 — DB performance:**
6. **HADES-03x** [P3] — Composite indexes (query_history, lead_outcomes), SQL pagination for operators (search_operators with LIKE+LIMIT/OFFSET), bounding-box pre-filter + LRU cache for get_zips_in_radius, PRAGMA table_info migration cleanup

**Batch 3 — Test quality:**
7. **HADES-0xw** [P3] — Fixed vacuous tests in test_expand_search.py (shadow variables → real imports), extracted time_ago() to utils.py, created tests/test_zoho.py with 31 tests

**Quick win:**
8. **HADES-59e** [P4] — 0-lead automation context message ("No new intent signals matched filters")

**Investigated but NOT started:**
9. **HADES-iic** [P4] — Zoho CRM dedup at export. User questioned the feature's purpose; needs clarification on CRM workflow before implementation. Reset to open.

### Test Count
672 tests passing (+44 from session start: 4 DB perf + 31 Zoho + 9 from other fixes)

### Key Files Modified

## Session Summary (2026-02-22, Session 34 continued)

### What Was Done

Completed 4 beads, all P1-P2 priority from the audit backlog:

1. **HADES-28z** [P1] — CI test workflow + pinned dependencies
   - Created `.github/workflows/test.yml` (lint + test on push/PR to main)
   - Generated `requirements-lock.txt` via `pip-compile` (307 lines)
   - Created `ruff.toml` with E+F rules, per-file ignores for Streamlit pages
   - Auto-fixed 52 ruff violations across 38 files
   - Found real bug: shadowed test (F811) — test count 598→599
   - Updated `intent-poll.yml` to use lock file

2. **HADES-mxm** [P2] — ZoomInfo API resilience
   - Circuit breaker: trips after 3 consecutive failures, 30s cooldown
   - Lowered MAX_RETRY_WAIT from 120s to 10s (prevents Streamlit UI freeze)
   - Fixed Contact Search pagination: use `totalPages` instead of fragile "fewer results than first page" heuristic

3. **HADES-io6** [P2] — Outcome recording consolidation
   - Extracted `build_outcome_row()` helper with superset of field fallbacks
   - Replaced inconsistent inline logic in intent pipeline and CSV export
   - Optimized `execute_many()` to use multi-row INSERT (1 round-trip vs N)
   - credits_used was already correctly handled — no fix needed

4. **HADES-3bo** [P2] — Config centralization
   - Added `search_defaults` section to `icp.yaml` (accuracy, mgmt levels, phone fields, target contacts, radius)
   - Added 6 getter functions to `utils.py`
   - Replaced hardcoded defaults in `expand_search.py`, pages/1, pages/2, intent pipeline script
   - Fixed radius inconsistency (10 vs 15 — unified at 15)

### Test Count
628 tests passing (+29 new this session: 12 circuit breaker/retry/pagination, 11 outcome/multi-row, 6 config getters)

### Key Files Modified
```
zoominfo_client.py              — circuit breaker, retry cap, pagination fix
turso_db.py                     — build_outcome_row(), multi-row INSERT
utils.py                        — 6 new config getter functions
config/icp.yaml                 — search_defaults section
expand_search.py                — config-driven defaults
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py      — config-driven defaults
pages/2_Geography_Workflow.py   — config-driven defaults
pages/4_CSV_Export.py           — consolidated outcome recording
scripts/run_intent_pipeline.py  — consolidated outcome recording, config getter
.github/workflows/test.yml     — NEW: CI test + lint workflow
.github/workflows/intent-poll.yml — use requirements-lock.txt
requirements-lock.txt           — NEW: pinned dependencies
ruff.toml                       — NEW: linter config (+ docs/briefing ignore)
tests/test_zoominfo_client.py   — 12 new resilience tests
tests/test_turso_db.py          — 11 new outcome/batch tests
tests/test_utils.py             — 6 new config getter tests
```

### Uncommitted Changes
Only `.beads/issues.jsonl` (bead state). Will be committed by bd sync.
Untracked: `docs/ux-review-session26.md` and `ux-review/` (pre-existing, not part of this session).

### Known Issues
- Ruff tries to lint YAML files if you pass `config/icp.yaml` directly — use `ruff check .` which respects file types
- SMTP secrets not configured in GitHub Actions (intent pipeline runs but skips email)

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **HADES-oa8** [P2] — UX: 1-click Geo search, contact mini-cards, Push button explanation
2. **HADES-03x** [P3] — DB performance: indexes, operators pagination, ZIP caching
3. **HADES-0xw** [P3] — Fix vacuous tests + extract time_ago + add Zoho test suite
4. **HADES-v3y** [P3] — UI polish: CSS typo, button standardization, WCAG contrast
5. **HADES-amm** [P3] — UX: Add export history section to CSV Export page

### Beads Status
- **Closed this session:** HADES-28z, HADES-mxm, HADES-io6, HADES-3bo
- **Closed earlier in session 34:** HADES-pt0 (security hardening — all 7 items)
- **All P0-P1 beads closed.** Remaining: 1 P2, 6 P3, 3 P4
- **Total:** 28 closed, 16 open, 0 in progress

## Session Summary (2026-02-22, Session 34)

### JWT Encryption at Rest (HADES-pt0 item 7) — DONE

Implemented Fernet split-secret encryption for ZoomInfo JWT persistence. The JWT stored in `sync_metadata` is now encrypted at rest — compromising Turso DB alone reveals nothing.

**Design:** Brainstormed 3 approaches (stop persisting, encrypt at rest, TTL cleanup). Chose Fernet split-secret: encrypted blob in Turso, decryption key (`ZOOMINFO_TOKEN_KEY`) in st.secrets.

**Implementation (5 commits, TDD throughout):**
1. Added `cryptography>=41.0` dependency
2. `_get_fernet()` — returns Fernet instance from secrets or None if unavailable
3. `_persist_token()` — encrypts before DB write, skips entirely if no key (NO plaintext fallback)
4. `_load_persisted_token()` — decrypts with `ttl=3600` (Fernet-level 1-hour TTL), skips if no key
5. Documented `ZOOMINFO_TOKEN_KEY` in CLAUDE.md

**Security properties:**
- No code path can write plaintext JWT to DB
- Fernet TTL rejects decryption after 1 hour (defense-in-depth)
- Tampered ciphertext detected via HMAC
- Backward-compatible: old plaintext tokens auto-migrate on first auth

**Subagent-driven development:** 3 implementer subagents + 4 spec reviewers + 3 code quality reviewers. All reviews passed.

### Test Count
591 tests passing (+9 new: 3 for _get_fernet, 5 for encrypt/decrypt, 1 for no-key load skip; 2 existing tests updated for encrypted mock data)

### Uncommitted Changes
None. All changes committed and pushed.

### HADES-pt0 (P1) — Security Hardening — PARTIALLY DONE

Item 7 (JWT encryption) is complete. Items 1-6 still open:
1. `hmac.compare_digest` for password check
2. Rate limiting on login attempts
3. XSS escape in `health_indicator()` detail
4. XSS escape in `_friendly_error()` output
5. `.env` not in `.gitignore`
6. Raw `{e}` in `st.error()` — 15+ locations

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **HADES-pt0** [P1] — Security hardening: items 1-6 (quick wins, ~30 min)
2. **HADES-28z** [P1] — CI test workflow + pin dependencies
3. **HADES-io6** [P2] — Outcome recording consolidation
4. **HADES-3bo** [P2] — Config centralization
5. **HADES-mxm** [P2] — ZoomInfo API resilience

### Deploy Note
After deploying, generate a Fernet key and add to Streamlit secrets:
```
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```
Add as `ZOOMINFO_TOKEN_KEY` in Streamlit Community Cloud secrets. Without the key, token persistence is disabled (app still works, just re-authenticates on every cold start).

## Session Summary (2026-02-22, Session 33)

### P0 Safety Guards (HADES-dd6) — CLOSED

Implemented all 5 safety guards from the audit findings:

1. **Confirmation dialog on VanillaSoft Push** (`pages/4_CSV_Export.py`) — `@st.dialog` shows lead count, operator, irreversibility warning. Push gated on `vs_push_confirmed` flag.
2. **Confirmation dialog on Run Now** (`pages/9_Automation.py`) — `@st.dialog` shows pipeline config and credit warning. Execution gated on `auto_run_confirmed` flag.
3. **Concurrent-run guard** (`scripts/run_intent_pipeline.py`) — `has_running_pipeline()` DB check before `start_pipeline_run()`. Returns early if pipeline already running.
4. **UNIQUE constraint on lead_outcomes** (`turso_db.py`) — `UNIQUE(batch_id, person_id)` index + `INSERT OR IGNORE`. Prevents duplicate outcome rows from inflating calibration stats.
5. **auto_run_triggered try/finally** (`pages/9_Automation.py`) — Flag now resets in `finally` block so button doesn't stay disabled after errors.

**Also fixed:** `person_id TEXT` column was missing from `CREATE TABLE lead_outcomes` in `init_schema()` (existed via ALTER TABLE migration but not in schema definition).

**Now unblocked:** HADES-ect (Batch Step 3 enrich N+1) and HADES-io6 (Outcome recording consolidation).

### HADES-ect (P1) — Batch Enrich + exclude_org_exported — CLOSED

1. **excludeOrgExportedContacts sent to API** (`zoominfo_client.py`) — field was in dataclass and cache hash but never in request body. Now sent when `exclude_org_exported=True` (default).
2. **Batch Step 3 ID resolution** (`scripts/run_intent_pipeline.py`) — replaced N+1 per-company `enrich_contacts_batch(person_ids=[single_pid])` loop with single batch call collecting all PIDs first. Saves ~24 credits per automated run.

### Test Count
582 tests passing (+4 from session start: UNIQUE constraint, has_running_pipeline, concurrent guard abort, step3 batch test)

### Uncommitted Changes
None. All changes committed and pushed.

### HADES-pt0 (P1) — Security Hardening — EXPLORED, NOT STARTED

Explored all 7 audit findings in this bead. Scoped 6 quick wins + 1 deferred:

1. `hmac.compare_digest` for password check (`utils.py:38` — currently `==`)
2. Rate limiting on login attempts (`utils.py:16-44` — no lockout or delay)
3. XSS escape in `health_indicator()` detail (`10_Pipeline_Health.py:96`)
4. XSS escape in `_friendly_error()` output (`9_Automation.py:72-89`)
5. `.env` not in `.gitignore` — add `.env` and `*.env`
6. Raw `{e}` in `st.error()` — 15+ locations exposing DB URLs/hostnames
7. JWT persisted unencrypted in DB (`zoominfo_client.py:265-275`) — **decision pending**: stop persisting (recommended, simplest) vs encrypt at rest vs defer

User was exploring the JWT encryption trade-offs when session ended. Resume this discussion next session.

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **HADES-pt0** [P1] — Security hardening: finish JWT decision, then implement all items
2. **HADES-28z** [P1] — CI test workflow + pin dependencies
3. **HADES-io6** [P2] — Outcome recording consolidation (NOW UNBLOCKED)
4. **HADES-3bo** [P2] — Config centralization
5. **HADES-mxm** [P2] — ZoomInfo API resilience

## Session Summary (2026-02-21, Session 31)

### Deep Engineering & UX Audit v2

Re-executed the comprehensive audit with 4 parallel research agents (codebase mapping, reliability/security, performance/debt, UI/UX) plus manual file verification. Produced 8 deliverables with 45 verified findings (vs 35 in session 30).

**New findings not in session 30 (10 new):**
- `record_lead_outcomes_batch` has no UNIQUE constraint — duplicate outcomes inflate calibration stats (P0)
- `execute_many` is a Python loop, not a true batch — 25 round-trips per export
- `time.sleep(retry_after)` blocks Streamlit UI thread for up to 120s during 429 recovery
- No circuit breaker on ZoomInfo API calls
- Fragile pagination stop condition in contact search
- Error hierarchy split between `errors.py` (1 class) and `zoominfo_client.py` (5 classes)
- Migration checks use exception message string matching
- Mixed `st.button` vs `ui.button` across all pages — no documented rule
- `text_muted` color below WCAG AA contrast ratio (3.8:1 vs required 4.5:1)
- Trends tab week boundaries use rolling windows, not calendar weeks

**Output:** `docs/audit-report-session31.md` (full 8-deliverable report with 45 findings)

### Key Files Created (Session 31)
```

## Session Summary (2026-02-20, Session 30)

### Comprehensive Engineering + UX Audit

Executed a deep 4-phase audit across the entire codebase: repository discovery, engineering audit (performance, reliability, security, tech debt, maintainability), UI/UX audit of all 10 pages, and 8 structured deliverables.

**Audit approach:** 6 parallel research agents covering DB/performance, API/reliability, security/secrets, test coverage/code quality, UI/UX, and repository discovery. All findings synthesized into a single report.

**Key findings (35 total):**
- **4 P0 issues:** No confirmation dialog on VanillaSoft Push or Run Now, no concurrent-run guard on intent pipeline, staging flags (`intent_leads_staged`/`geo_leads_staged`) not in session state defaults dict
- **17 P1 issues:** Including `turso_db.py` god object (37 methods, 11 domains), unpinned dependencies, vacuous tests, missing DB indexes, `exclude_org_exported` silently dropped, unencrypted OAuth token in DB
- **14 P2 issues:** Including ZIP brute-force on every rerun, accordion-heavy UI, mixed component libraries, no CI test gate

**Deliverables produced (D1-D8):**
1. Executive summary with severity breakdown
2. Findings table (35 entries) with file:line evidence
3. Architecture map (module → DB → API data flow)
4. Performance section with 5 optimization hypotheses
5. Tech debt register with effort estimates
6. UI/UX critique per page (all 10 pages)
7. 3-sprint roadmap (stability → performance → polish)
8. "Fix 3 Things" recommendation (confirmation dialogs, turso_db split, pin dependencies)

**Output:** `docs/audit-report-session30.md`

### Key Files Created (Session 30)

## Session Summary (2026-02-20, Session 29)

### Deployed App Testing + Bug Fixes

Tested all 9 pages on the live Streamlit Community Cloud deployment (hades-hlm.streamlit.app). Found and fixed 4 issues, all committed and pushed.

**Fixes shipped:**
- **`:help[]` artifacts on metric cards** — `st.markdown()` doesn't support the `help` param; was rendering raw `:help[]` text on SCC's Streamlit version. Moved help text to HTML `title` attribute. Affected: Homepage, Usage Dashboard, Executive Summary.
- **Pipeline Health false Critical alert** — Staleness check only read `query_history` (manual UI runs), missing `pipeline_runs` (automated scheduled runs). Now considers both sources, uses whichever is most recent.
- **Blank SIC in Score Calibration outcomes** — CSV Export outcome recording didn't check nested `company` dict for SIC code. Added fallback to `lead["company"]["sicCode"]`, matching the automation script's pattern. Also fixed company name, employee count, ZIP, state fallbacks.
- **Misleading "review details" label** — `get_priority_action()` returned "Good prospect — review details" which looked like a clickable link. Changed to "Good prospect — worth a call".
- **Orange "Stale" badges on homepage** — Intent/Geography status showed alarming "Stale" warnings for normal usage gaps. Replaced with neutral gray badges showing time-ago ("2d ago") with lead count in detail line.

**Also produced:** Comprehensive self-prompt for deep engineering + UX audit (not yet executed).

### Key Files Modified (Session 29)

### Test Count
578 tests passing (unchanged)

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Execute deep audit** — self-prompt produced this session covers engineering + UX across all modules
2. **Remaining UX beads (9 ready)** — HADES-amm (export history), HADES-fvm (auto-fetch usage), HADES-tku (recent operators), HADES-3sw (automation on Home), etc.
3. **Existing SIC data** — 5 leads in lead_outcomes have blank SIC from before the fix; could backfill if ZoomInfo data is available
4. **Weekend staleness** — Pipeline Health 26h threshold will still fire over weekends (Fri→Mon = 63h); consider weekday-aware threshold

## Session Summary (2026-02-20, Session 28)

### Operators Page: Select-Then-Act + Design Overhaul

Replaced per-row shadcn Edit/Delete buttons with a select-then-act pattern to eliminate iframe bloat (~60 iframes → max 3). Rebuilt operator rows as custom HTML for full typographic control. Ran design critique and frontend-design passes to refine density, typography, and visual hierarchy.

**Performance fix:**
- Each operator row previously rendered 3 shadcn iframes (Edit + Delete + alert_dialog)
- Now: native `st.button("⋮")` per row, shadcn buttons only for the selected operator
- 20 operators × 3 iframes = 60 → max 3 iframes on the page

**Design refinements:**
- Operator rows rendered as custom HTML (`op-row` class) with display font names, inline muted business names, monospace contact info
- Removed emoji from contact info (📞 ✉️ 📍 🌐) → clean `·` separators with clickable `mailto:` email links
- Removed per-row dividers + empty spacers → subtle CSS border-bottom, 3x density improvement
- Tertiary buttons (⋮/✕) styled at 40% opacity, brighten on hover
- Missing business names omitted instead of showing "—"
- Visible operators above fold: ~4 → ~12

**Deployment prep:**
- Verified SCC readiness: requirements.txt, config.toml, data files, secrets.gitignore
- DEV_MODE pages (Pipeline Test, API Discovery) gated — won't show in production
- Walked through SCC deployment steps (not yet deployed)

### Key Files Modified (Session 28)
```
pages/3_Operators.py   - Select-then-act pattern, custom HTML row rendering
ui_components.py       - Operator row CSS, tertiary button hover styles
```

### Beads Closed
- HADES-wmv: Replace shadcn buttons on Operators page (resolved via select-then-act)

### Uncommitted Changes
None. All work committed and pushed.

### Test Count
578 tests passing (unchanged — display-layer changes only)

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud** — repo connected, secrets need configuring in SCC dashboard
2. **Remaining UX beads (9 ready)** — HADES-amm (export history), HADES-fvm (auto-fetch usage), HADES-tku (recent operators), HADES-3sw (automation on Home), etc.
3. **Production testing** — verify app works on SCC with real Turso/ZoomInfo connections

## Session Summary (2026-02-19, Session 27)

### UX Review Fixes (15 planned) + Design Critique

Implemented 15 UX fixes from session 26 review across 4 batches, caught 2 additional state-dependent rendering bugs during visual verification, then ran `interface-design:critique` skill to rebuild the home page composition. 578 tests green throughout.

**Branch:** `ux-fixes-session26` (off main)

**Batch 1 — Text/Display (4 fixes):**
- Fix 1: `**bold**` → `<strong>bold</strong>` in Intent preview (HTML context)
- Fix 7: Removed step number labels from Home quick actions
- Fix 8: Fixed "1 leads" → "1 lead" grammar
- Fix 9: Added "Staged" tooltip caption on CSV Export page

**Batch 2 — Logic/Thresholds (5 fixes):**
- Fix 3: Pipeline Health Critical threshold 6h → 26h (business-hours appropriate)
- Fix 4: Executive Summary efficiency "credits per lead" → "leads per credit"
- Fix 5: Score Calibration badge shows "N of 25 calibrated" when SIC scores exist
- Fix 10: ZoomInfo API no-token status: yellow/Stale → green/Ready
- Fix 14: Removed "not exported" tag from Recent Runs (only show "exported" when true)

**Batch 3 — Structural Layout (3 fixes):**
- Fix 13: Geography workflow Mode Selector moved above Step Indicator (matches Intent order)
- Fix 12: CSV Export per-batch button grid → single "Load Most Recent" button
- Fix 15: Removed redundant `workflow_summary_strip()` from Executive Summary

**Batch 4 — Error Handling + Dev Gating (3 fixes):**
- Fix 6: `_friendly_error()` mapper for Automation run cards (raw msg kept in expanded details)
- Fix 2: Operator phone numbers now formatted via `format_phone()`
- Fix 11: Pipeline Test + API Discovery gated behind `DEV_MODE` secret, titles suffixed "(Dev)"

**Additional fixes caught during visual review:**
- Home page "No leads staged" floating text → neutral badge + "Staged Leads" caption
- Intent Workflow preview-to-target spacing gap (added `st.markdown("")` spacer)
- API Discovery hidden from sidebar via CSS (`display: none` on href match)

**Design Critique Rebuild:**
- Home page quick actions: bare `st.page_link` → `.quick-action` card components with icon/title/desc hierarchy
- Status row: 4 floating columns → single grouped HTML card with flex layout
- Sidebar icons: added entries for pages 9-12 (Score Calibration ⚖️, API Discovery 🔬, Automation ⚙️, Pipeline Health 💚)
- Quick-action CSS: tightened spacing, display font for titles, increased icon size

## Session Summary (2026-02-19, Session 25)

### Structural UX Fixes — 6 Issues Found & Fixed

User-driven review caught structural UX issues that cosmetic reviews (sessions 22/24) missed. All fixes verified in browser via Playwright. 578 tests passing.

**Fix 1 — Home page duplication removed:**
- Quick-action cards + "Open X" buttons were triple-redundant with sidebar navigation
- Replaced card HTML + button combo with single `st.page_link` per action + captions
- Removed unused `styled_table` and `pandas` imports from home page

**Fix 2 — Recent Runs now clickable:**
- Replaced static `styled_table` with `st.expander` rows
- Each run expandable to show query parameters (ZIPs, radius, states, filters, etc.)
- Added comprehensive display key mapping for all parameter names

**Fix 3 — Intent query logging enriched:**
- Was logging only 2 fields (topics, signal_strengths) — now logs 7
- Added: target_companies, management_levels, accuracy_min, phone_fields, mode
- Matches Geography workflow's logging depth (9 fields)

**Fix 4 — "Unknown" company name bug fixed:**
- Intent workflow had NO pre-enrichment field preservation (Geography had it since session 17)
- Enrich API replaces contact objects, losing `companyName` field
- Added pre-enrichment save/restore pattern matching Geography workflow
- Also added nested `company.name` fallback in CSV Export display (2 locations)

**Fix 5 — Stale badge tooltip added:**
- `status_badge()` now accepts `tooltip` parameter (HTML `title` attribute)
- Stale badges show "No queries in {N}h — run a new search to refresh"
- Active badges show "Last run within 6 hours"
- Added `cursor: help` CSS for badges with tooltips

**Fix 6 — UX review prompt documented:**
- Created `docs/ux-review-prompt.md` — reusable 4-phase review methodology
- Phases: User Journey Walkthroughs → Structural Analysis → Cross-Cutting Concerns → Optimization Proposals
- Designed to catch structural issues that cosmetic reviews miss

### Key Files Modified (Session 25)
```
app.py                         - Quick actions consolidated, expander runs, stale tooltips
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py     - Pre-enrichment field preservation, enriched query logging
pages/4_CSV_Export.py          - Nested company.name fallback (2 locations)
ui_components.py               - status_badge tooltip param, cursor:help CSS
docs/ux-review-prompt.md       - NEW: reusable UX review prompt
```

### Uncommitted Changes
5 files (4 modified + 1 new). Ready to commit.

### Test Count
578 tests passing (unchanged — UI-only fixes)

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud** — app is code-complete, secrets need configuring
2. **Delete test contacts in VanillaSoft** — 4-5 duplicates from testing
3. **Enable "Update existing contacts" in VanillaSoft** — Set Update Key = Email
4. **Live test Contact Enrich** — API parses correctly, untested with production data
5. **Run full UX review** — Use `docs/ux-review-prompt.md` for comprehensive structural review
6. **Plan compliance gaps** — HADES-umv (P4, 9 items)
7. **Zoho CRM dedup check at export** — HADES-iic (P4)
8. **Configure SMTP secrets** — For GitHub Actions email delivery

### Open Beads (2)
- HADES-umv [P4 task] — Plan compliance: missing CTA, error log, PII enforcement, doc updates

## Session Summary (2026-02-19, Session 24)

### Comprehensive UX Review — 30 Fixes Across 10 Pages

Implemented a full UX/UI review plan addressing 30 issues plus 5 cross-page consistency gaps. All changes are cosmetic — no new features or logic changes. 578 tests passing.

**Batch 1 — Home Page:**
- Sequential step labels ("Step 1", "Step 2") on quick action cards
- Freshness badges (Active/Stale) on Intent/Geography status indicators (6h threshold)
- Help text context on metric cards ("Since Monday", "Last 100 queries", "Active records")

**Batch 2 — Usage Dashboard / Automation / Executive Summary:**
- Renamed "Raw Response" → "API Diagnostics" expander
- Help text on ZoomInfo usage metrics + most constrained limit caption
- Formatted automation run details as key-value pairs (was raw JSON)
- Next Run shows countdown + absolute date (was ambiguous format)
- Config section collapsed into read-only expander
- Workflow summary strip below Executive Summary header

**Batch 3 — Executive Summary / Score Calibration:**
- 4 KPI metric cards above narrative metrics in Overview tab
- Chart titles and y-axis labels on all Plotly charts
- Efficiency callout below workflow comparison table
- Score Calibration page intro text + "Never calibrated" warning badge
- SIC table search filter by code or industry name
- Employee scale explanation caption

**Batch 4 — Workflow Pages:**
- Dual `parameter_group()` filters on Intent (was single expander)
- Stronger `st.subheader` for step headers (was `labeled_divider`)
- Empty state hint on Geography when no operator selected
- Demoted Autopilot info from info box to caption
- Swapped Operators sync button weights (Sync Changes → primary)
- Pagination divider + count indicator

**Batch 5 — Pipeline Health:**
- Critical alert banner at page top when any subsystem is red
- 2x2 grid layout for health indicators (was vertical stack)
- Query activity converted to `styled_table` with pill badges

### Key Files Modified (Session 24)
```
app.py                          - Step labels, freshness badges, help_text
ui_components.py                - .qa-step CSS class
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py      - Dual parameter_group, subheader steps
pages/2_Geography_Workflow.py   - Empty state hint, Autopilot → caption
pages/3_Operators.py            - Sync button weights, spacers, pagination divider
pages/5_Usage_Dashboard.py      - API Diagnostics rename, help_text, constrained limit
pages/6_Executive_Summary.py    - KPI cards, chart titles, efficiency callout
pages/7_Score_Calibration.py    - Intro text, warning badge, SIC filter, employee caption
pages/9_Automation.py           - Formatted run details, countdown+date, config expander
pages/10_Pipeline_Health.py     - Critical alert, 2x2 grid, styled_table activity
```

### Visual Check + Code Review
- Spot-checked all 10 pages in Chrome (dark theme) — all changes render correctly
- GIF recording exported: `hades-ux-review-visual-check.gif`
- Code review found 1 bug: `datetime` import was inside `if last_intent:` block in `app.py`, causing `NameError` when only Geography data exists — **fixed** (moved to module-level import)
- Reviewer confirmed O3 pagination count was already implemented (line 257)

### Commits (Session 24)
```
235a505 ui: comprehensive UX review — 30 fixes across 10 pages
1244a69 docs: session 24 handoff - comprehensive UX review (30 fixes, 10 pages)

2. Live test Geography pipeline end-to-end
3. Live test enrichment with real data

## Session Summary (2026-02-19, Session 23)

### Bug Fixes (3) + Score Transparency (7 tasks) + VanillaSoft Live Test

**HADES-umc (P2 bug) — Fragile push result matching FIXED:**
- VanillaSoft push results matched leads by name+company (fragile — duplicates, typos)
- Threaded `personId` through entire push pipeline: lead → `build_vanillasoft_row()` → `push_lead()` → `PushResult` → matching
- Falls back to name+company when personId absent (backwards compatible)
- 5 new tests in `test_vanillasoft_client.py`, 4 in `test_export.py`

**HADES-rac (P3 bug) — Pipeline Health defensive access FIXED:**
- `last_query['workflow_type']` → `.get('workflow_type', 'unknown')` (2 locations)

**HADES-bs4 (P3 bug) — Pipeline Health timezone mismatch FIXED:**
- Staleness calculation used naive datetime comparison; failed in try/except showing gray "Unknown"
- Fixed to timezone-aware pattern matching `time_ago()` helper

**Score Transparency & Actionable Prioritization (NEW FEATURE):**
- `get_priority_action(score)` — "Call first — strong match" / "Good prospect — review details" / "Lower fit — call if capacity allows"
- `generate_score_summary(lead, workflow_type)` — plain-English sentence from component scores (e.g., "Nearby (3 mi) · director · 250 employees · strong industry fit (Hotels)")
- `score_breakdown(lead, workflow_type)` — HTML horizontal bars per scoring factor, color-coded green/yellow/gray by strength tier
- Wired into Geography Workflow, Intent Workflow, and CSV Export pages
- Priority column upgraded to show action phrases (hidden `_priority_label` preserves filter compatibility)
- Score expander respects active filters (only shows filtered leads)
- Defensive distance formatting for messy data
- 17 new tests (6 priority action, 5 summary, 6 breakdown)
- Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-19-score-transparency-design.md`

**VanillaSoft Push — LIVE TESTED AND WORKING:**
- Set up Incoming Web Lead profile "HADES" in VanillaSoft Admin (WebLeadID: 166065)
- 26 field mappings configured (Employees and LineOfBusiness unmapped — not in VanillaSoft)
- Configured `VANILLASOFT_WEB_LEAD_ID = "166065"` in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- Pushed 2 test leads (Peter Metzger, Jason Stellingwerf) — both accepted by VanillaSoft
- Found and fixed case mismatch bug: VanillaSoft returns `SUCCESS` (all caps), parser expected `Success`
- All 26 mapped fields imported correctly per VanillaSoft confirmation emails
- Email notifications working (andre.savkin@vendtech.com on success/error)
- Recommended keeping "Create duplicates" ON (contacts share company phones) + enabling "Update existing contacts" by Email for re-push safety

## Session Summary (2026-02-18, Session 22)

### UI Consistency, Auth Gate, Damione Briefings

**UI Consistency Improvements (4 batches from ChatGPT UX review):**
- Replaced plain `---` dividers with `labeled_divider()` across 5 pages (app.py, CSV Export, Usage Dashboard, Score Calibration)
- Fixed step indicator bug in Geography autopilot mode — returned 4 for 3-step workflow, causing all steps to show "completed" instead of final step "active"
- Equal metric columns in Geography results (`st.columns(3)` instead of `[2,1,1]`)
- Clearer operator caption and bulleted welcome text in Geography Workflow
- Source column in Score Calibration now shows green "calibrated" / gray "default" pill badges
- Pipeline Health timestamps use monospace formatting to prevent wrapping
- Quick-action cards on home page: lighter border (`border_light`) + base `box-shadow` for contrast
- Intent filter summary text bumped from 12px to 14px (`0.875rem`)

**Password Auth Gate (new feature):**
- `require_auth()` function in `utils.py` — checks `APP_PASSWORD` from `st.secrets`
- Gates all 12 pages (app.py + 11 page files) — called right after `inject_base_styles()`
- Session state persistence — login once per browser session
- Graceful skip when `APP_PASSWORD` not configured (local dev works unchanged)
- Added `APP_PASSWORD` to secrets template in CLAUDE.md

**Damione Briefing Documents:**
- `docs/briefing/HADES_Briefing.pdf` — 12-page product overview with 9 screenshots explaining every page in plain English
- `docs/briefing/HADES_Development_Complexity.pdf` — 8-page document explaining why development is time-consuming, backed by codebase metrics (17k LOC, 551 tests, 7 integrations, 70 session state vars)
- Screenshots captured via Playwright MCP automation
- PDF generation via `fpdf2` build scripts (also committed)

**Beads Created (3 pre-existing issues found by CodeRabbit):**
- HADES-rac (P3 bug) — Pipeline Health defensive `.get()` access
- HADES-bs4 (P3 bug) — Pipeline Health timezone mismatch in staleness calc
- HADES-umc (P2 bug) — CSV Export fragile name+company matching for push results

## Session Summary (2026-02-18, Session 21)

### Bug Fixes, UX Improvements, Contact Skip Feature

**Pipeline Health — "Last Query: Error" misleading (FIX):**
- Red status on Last Query showed "Error" when the query actually succeeded — it was just stale (>6h old)
- Changed label from "Error" → "Critical" globally for red status indicators
- Added staleness explanation to detail text: "No queries in 11h (threshold: 6h)"
- Yellow (1-6h) also now explains: "No queries in over Xh"

**"unhashable type: 'list'" bug (FIX — found by ChatGPT UX review):**
- Root cause: ZoomInfo API sometimes returns `company` field as a list instead of dict
- `.get("company", {}).get("id")` crashes with `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`
- Fixed across 7 files with `isinstance(contact.get("company"), dict)` guards
- Added `safe_company()` helper to `utils.py` for reuse

**Intent export missing Primary SIC (FIX):**
- Intent Contact Search and Enrich APIs don't return `sicCode` (subscription-gated field)
- But intent company data from Step 1 (Intent Search) has it
- `score_intent_contacts()` in `scoring.py` now carries `sicCode`, `employees`, `industry` from company data onto contacts when missing
- Geography workflow already handled this correctly via pre-enrichment data restore

**Contact skip/unselect for enrichment (FEATURE — both workflows):**
- Added "Skip — don't enrich" option to each company's radio group in manual review
- Skipping a company removes it from selected contacts — no credit spent
- Re-selecting a contact adds the company back
- Enrich button disabled with warning when all companies skipped
- Skip count shown: "8 of 12 companies selected · 4 skipped"
- Added bulk "Select all best" and "Skip all" buttons to both workflows
- Use case: Skip all → cherry-pick the ones you want → enrich

### Key Files Modified (Session 21)
```
pages/10_Pipeline_Health.py     - Staleness detail + "Critical" label
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py      - Skip/unselect contacts, bulk buttons, safe_company guards

## Session Summary (2026-02-18, Session 20)

### VanillaSoft Direct Push + Export Button Clarity

**VanillaSoft Direct Push Feature (NEW):**
- Built `vanillasoft_client.py` — HTTP POST client for VanillaSoft Incoming Web Leads endpoint
- `PushResult`/`PushSummary` dataclasses, XML serialization via `ElementTree`, `_build_xml()`
- `push_lead()` — single-lead POST with timeout/connection/HTTP error handling
- `push_leads()` — sequential batch with progress callback, 200ms delay between POSTs
- `_parse_response()` — XML response parsing with fallback for malformed responses
- Export page (`pages/4_CSV_Export.py`) rewritten: "Push to VanillaSoft" primary button + "Download CSV" secondary
- Push flow: progress bar, per-lead success/failure log, outcome tracking for succeeded leads only
- Failed leads: retry button + "Download Failed as CSV" fallback
- Push button disabled with tooltip when `VANILLASOFT_WEB_LEAD_ID` secret not configured
- DB: 3 new columns on `staged_exports` (push_status, pushed_at, push_results_json) + `mark_staged_pushed()` method
- Idempotent ALTER TABLE migrations for existing databases

**Export Button Rename (UX Fix):**
- Workflow pages: "Download CSV" → "Quick Preview CSV" (with tooltip: "Simple table export for review — not VanillaSoft format")
- Workflow pages: "Full Export" → "VanillaSoft Export"
- Filenames: `geo_contacts_` → `geo_preview_`, `intent_contacts_` → `intent_preview_`

**Code Review Findings Fixed:**
- Tightened `_parse_response()` fallback from `"Success" in text` to `"<ReturnValue>Success</ReturnValue>" in text` (prevents false positive on strings like "SuccessRateExceeded")

## What's Working

1. **Authentication** - Legacy JWT from `/authenticate`, token persisted to Turso DB across restarts
2. **Contact Search** - All filters working, including companyId-based search (`/search/contact`)
3. **Contact Enrich** - 3-level nested response parsing confirmed working in live pipeline run
4. **Intent Search** - Legacy `/search/intent` with proper field normalization (nested `company` object + null field fallbacks)
5. **Two-Phase Intent Pipeline** - Phase 1: Resolve hashed→numeric company IDs (enrich 1 contact, cache in Turso). Phase 2: Contact Search with ICP filters (management level, accuracy, phone)
6. **Scoring** - Data-calibrated per-SIC scores from HLM delivery data (N=3,136). Inverted employee scale. 25 SIC codes.
7. **CSV Export** - VanillaSoft format, supports both workflows + validation checklist + mobile phone formatting
8. **Test Mode** - Skips enrichment step only (search calls still use real API)
9. **Target Contacts Expansion** - Auto-expand search to meet target count (Geography)
10. **Combined Location Search** - Toggle to merge PersonAndHQ + Person results (Geography)
11. **UX Overhaul** - Full-width layout, action bar, summary strip, run logs, export validation
12. **Shadcn UI** - `streamlit-shadcn-ui` adopted across all pages
13. **API Debug Panel** - Intent Workflow shows raw API keys, raw first item, normalized sample, request/response
14. **Turso Reconnect** - Auto-reconnects on stale Hrana stream errors (survives idle timeouts)
15. **Token Persistence** - ZoomInfo JWT saved to Turso `sync_metadata` table, loaded on restart
16. **Company ID Cache** - Turso `company_id_mapping` table persists hashed→numeric ID resolutions across sessions
17. **Editable Contact Filters** - Management level, accuracy minimum, phone fields editable in Intent Workflow Filters expander
18. **Calibration Script** - `calibrate_scoring.py` analyzes enriched delivery data and outputs per-SIC scores
19. **Intent Polling Automation** - Headless pipeline script, GitHub Actions cron (Mon-Fri 7AM ET), manual Run Now button, pipeline_runs DB tracking, Automation dashboard page
20. **Design System** - Extracted from `ui_components.py` into `.interface-design/system.md` — color tokens, typography, spacing, component patterns
21. **Staged Exports** - Workflow results persist to `staged_exports` table, survive browser refresh

## Known Issues

- **v2 Intent API requires OAuth2 PKCE** — The new `/gtm/data/v1/intent/search` endpoint rejects legacy JWT. Using legacy endpoint instead.
- **`@st.cache_resource` gotcha** — Code changes to cached classes require Streamlit restart.
- **Contact Enrich** — Response parsing fixed but never tested with real production data.
- **Intent search is free** — Only enrichment costs credits. Intent search `credits_used` set to 0.
- **Valid intent topics** — Must use exact ZoomInfo taxonomy: "Vending Machines", "Breakroom Solutions", "Coffee Services", "Water Coolers" (not "Vending", "Break Room", etc.)
- **SMTP secrets not configured** — GitHub Actions has 4 required secrets set (Turso + ZoomInfo) but SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD, EMAIL_RECIPIENTS not set. Pipeline runs but skips email delivery.
- **managementLevel as list** — ZoomInfo enrich API returns `managementLevel` as a list (e.g. `["Manager"]`) while Contact Search returns a string. Fixed in scoring.py (session 12).

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 19)

### Two P3 Features + Code Review

**HADES-1wk — Rapidfuzz Fuzzy Matching for Cross-Workflow Dedup (CLOSED):**
- Added `fuzzy_company_match()` to `dedup.py` using `rapidfuzz.fuzz.token_sort_ratio`
- Default threshold 85, configurable in `icp.yaml` at `dedup.fuzzy_threshold`
- Fuzzy fallback added to `find_duplicates()`, `merge_lead_lists()`, `flag_duplicates_in_list()`
- Within-workflow dedup stays exact match (by design — ZoomInfo returns consistent names)
- Catches typos ("Acmee" vs "Acme"), abbreviations ("St" vs "Saint"), word reordering
- 15 new tests (7 unit + 4 find_duplicates + 3 merge + 1 flag)

**HADES-5xm — Expansion Timeline Component (CLOSED):**
- Added structured `expansion_steps` list to `expand_search()` result dict
- Each step records: param changed, old value, new value, contacts found, new companies, cumulative companies
- Built `expansion_timeline()` component in `ui_components.py` — styled HTML rows with left-border accent
- Wired into Geography Workflow inside `st.expander("Expansion details", expanded=True)`
- 8 new tests (3 data structure + 5 UI rendering)

**CodeRabbit Code Review — 2 issues found and fixed:**
1. `_get_fuzzy_threshold()` — Added `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` to avoid redundant dict lookups in O(n×m) loops
2. Geography page — Guarded edge case where `steps_applied > 0` but `expansion_steps` empty (failed step)

### Key Files Modified (Session 19)
```
dedup.py                        - fuzzy_company_match(), lru_cache, fuzzy fallback in 3 functions

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 18)

### Intent Pipeline E2E Live Test + All Pages Verified + Bug Fix

**Intent Pipeline E2E (HADES-kbu — PASSED):**
- Ran full pipeline via Playwright browser automation
- Manual Review mode, Vending Machines topic, High signal strength
- Search: 4 companies found (Dry Harbor, Sagora Senior Living, Huron Valley PACE, Peace Corps)
- Contact Search: 18 contacts across 3 companies (Dry Harbor had 0 ICP matches)
- Enrichment: 3 contacts enriched (3 credits used)
- Results: Jaclyn Dukes (Huron Valley PACE, 79%), Jean Togbe (Peace Corps, 77%), Christal Hoffman (Sagora Senior Living, 76%)
- Download CSV and Full Export buttons functional

**All Pages Verified:**
- Operators: 3,041 operators, pagination (20/page, 153 pages), search, Edit/Delete, Add
- CSV Export: 3 staged exports (Intent 3 leads, Geography 30+35 leads), Load buttons
- Usage Dashboard: 93 credits this week, Intent 63/500, tabs (Weekly/By Period/Recent Queries)
- Executive Summary: Narrative metrics, Plotly charts, efficiency table, tabs (Overview/Trends/Budget)
- Pipeline Health: 4 green indicators (Last Query, Cache, Database, ZoomInfo API), run history
- Automation: Next run countdown, Run Now button, run history, configuration display

**Bug Found & Fixed (HADES-6s4):**
7. **HTML rendered as code blocks** — `narrative_metric()` and `_run_card_html()` used indented f-string HTML. Streamlit's markdown parser treated 4+ space-indented lines as `<code>` blocks before `unsafe_allow_html=True` applied. Fix: removed leading whitespace from HTML strings (same root cause as `empty_state` bug from session 12).

### Key Files Modified (Session 18)
```
ui_components.py               - narrative_metric() HTML de-indented
pages/9_Automation.py           - _run_card_html() HTML de-indented
```

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 17)

### Bug Fixes + Geography Pipeline E2E Live Test

**4 P2 Bugs Fixed (commit `e739391`):**
1. **Token persistence** (HADES-ti1) — Expired in-memory token skipped DB check. Restructured `_get_token()`: in-memory → DB → authenticate.
2. **Thread-safety** (HADES-4vu) — Shared `ZoomInfoClient` singleton mutated from multiple threads. Added `threading.Lock()` around token auth, rate limiting, and 401 re-auth.
3. **XSS escaping** (HADES-1nn) — API-sourced data interpolated into raw HTML. Added `html.escape()` on company names, contact names, management levels, progress log messages.
4. **Geography score clamp** (HADES-8fd) — Composite score could exceed 100. Added `min(100, round(composite))`.

**Geography Pipeline E2E Live Test (HADES-kyi — PASSED):**
- Ran full pipeline via Chrome MCP browser automation
- Operator: Bridget Crouse · Dallas Rose (PA, ZIP 17036)
- Manual Review mode, 5 target companies, 15mi radius
- Search: 30 companies found (expansion: +Director/VP, +employee range, accuracy→75, radius→20mi, 7 searches)
- Enrichment: 30 contacts enriched (30 credits used)
- Scoring: 64-76%, all Medium priority
- Quality Notes: 3/30 missing mobile, 3/30 low accuracy
- Quick CSV + VanillaSoft CSV (31 columns) both downloaded successfully
- GIF recording: `geography-pipeline-e2e-test.gif` (50 frames)

**2 Bugs Found During Testing & Fixed (commit `500cef3`):**
5. **VanillaSoft export missing fields** (HADES-0rp) — Enrich API replaces contact object, losing search-only fields (`sicCode`, `employeeCount`, `industry`). Also uses different field names (`companyWebsite` vs `website`). Fix: expanded pre-enrichment field preservation + added enrich API fallback mappings.
6. **Loc Type column empty** (HADES-7g5) — `_location_type` only tagged when combined search enabled. Fix: always tag contacts with location type from search params.

### Key Files Modified (Session 17)
```
scoring.py                     - Score clamp: min(100, round(composite))
zoominfo_client.py             - Token persistence restructure + threading.Lock

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 16)

### Retrospective + Code Review + Bug Fixes

**Retrospective (All 4 Epics Combined)**
- Ran BMAD retrospective workflow across Epics 1-4 (18 stories, 15 sessions)
- Key insights: spike-then-plan for API projects, mocked tests give partial false confidence, update docs at milestones
- 9 action items, 3 team agreements, 2 critical path items identified
- Retrospective saved: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-1-4-retro-2026-02-17.md`

**Dual Code Review (feature-dev + superpowers reviewers in parallel)**
- `feature-dev:code-reviewer` found 6 issues (2 critical, 4 important)
- `superpowers:code-reviewer` found 6 plan compliance gaps + convention violations
- Zero overlap between reviewers — complementary findings

**2 Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. **directPhone overwritten by phone in export** (`utils.py:440`, `export.py:65`) — Both `directPhone` and `phone` mapped to "Business" column. Generic `phone` silently overwrote higher-quality `directPhone`. Fix: removed duplicate mapping, added explicit fallback in `build_vanillasoft_row()`.
2. **Batch counter incremented every page render** (`pages/4_CSV_Export.py:312`) — `generate_batch_id(db)` did a DB write on every Streamlit rerun. Fix: cached export output in session state keyed by lead set + operator.

**7 Beads Created for Remaining Issues:**
- 3 bugs (P2): token persistence, thread-safety, XSS escaping
- 1 bug (P3): geography score unclamped
- 2 features (P3): rapidfuzz dedup, expansion_timeline component
- 1 task (P4): grouped plan compliance gaps (9 items)

### Key Files Modified (Session 16)
```
utils.py                      - Removed duplicate phone->Business mapping
export.py                     - Added directPhone fallback logic
pages/4_CSV_Export.py          - Cached export to prevent batch_id rerun writes
tests/test_export.py           - 3 new tests (directPhone priority)
_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-1-4-retro-2026-02-17.md - NEW: retrospective doc
```

### Uncommitted Changes

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 15)

### All Remaining Stories Implemented (4 stories)

Committed session 14 changes (2 commits: project code + BMAD tooling) then implemented all 4 remaining story gaps.

**Story 2.6: Cross-Workflow Dedup UI**
- Added dedup check section to CSV Export page (`pages/4_CSV_Export.py`)
- When both Intent and Geography leads are staged, detects cross-workflow duplicates
- Shows duplicate table with scores from both workflows, "Kept In" pill indicator
- Checkbox to exclude lower-scored duplicates (default: ON)
- Uses existing `find_duplicates()` and `flag_duplicates_in_list()` from `dedup.py`

**Story 4.1: Usage Dashboard Date Range Filter**
- Added `get_queries_by_date_range()` to `turso_db.py` with start/end date + optional workflow filter
- Replaced hardcoded `limit=20` "Recent Queries" tab with date range selector
- Options: This Week, This Month, Last 30 Days, Custom (date picker)
- Added workflow filter dropdown (All/Intent/Geography)
- Added "Exported" column to query history table

**Story 4.2: Executive Summary Narrative Metrics**
- Created `narrative_metric()` component in `ui_components.py`
- Renders metrics as sentences with highlighted values (accent color, mono font)
- Left border accent, optional subtext for context
- Updated Executive Summary Overview tab: "312 leads exported at 2.38 credits per lead"
- Budget narrative: "487 of 500 (97%) weekly Intent credits used"
- Geography narrative: "23 searches this month · no credit cap"

**Story 4.3: Pipeline Health Dashboard**
- Created `pages/10_Pipeline_Health.py` — entirely new page
- 4 health indicators with green/yellow/red dot + status label:
  - Last Query (green <1h, yellow <6h, red >6h)
  - Cache (active/total entries, newest entry age)
  - Database (Turso connection ping)
  - ZoomInfo API (token validity check)
- Recent pipeline runs table with status pills (Completed/Failed/Running)
- Recent query activity summary

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 14)

### Epic 1-3 Implementation (12 Tasks)

Implemented all 6 Epic 1 stories plus 5 quick fixes and 2 medium features from Epics 2-3. Used feature-dev skill with code-explorer and code-architect agents for Epic 1, then gap analysis for remaining epics.

**Epic 1 — Intent Lead Pipeline (6 stories):**
- **Story 1.1**: PipelineError hierarchy (`errors.py`). ZoomInfoError + BudgetExceededError inherit from it. PII hygiene: bare `except` replaced with `logger.exception()` + generic UI messages. 19 tests.
- **Story 1.2**: Query preview line (topics, signal threshold, employee range, SIC codes in popover).
- **Story 1.3**: Lead Source tag format `"ZoomInfo Intent - {topic} - {score} - {age}d"`. Call Priority from `_priority`. Geo source tag `"ZoomInfo Geo - {zip} - {radius}mi"`.
- **Story 1.4**: Cache-first lookup with SHA-256 hash key, 7-day TTL. "Cached" indicator + "Refresh" button. Cache hits logged with credits=0.
- **Story 1.5**: Operator page `empty_state()` + success toast after creation.
- **Story 1.6**: Export filename format `HADES-{type}-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv`.

**Epic 2-3 Gap Fixes (5 quick + 2 medium):**
- Budget button disabled when >= 100% (Story 3.1)
- Header badge thresholds aligned to 50/80/95% (Story 3.2)
- Cache hits logged to cost_tracker + query_history (Story 3.3)
- Location templates UI — "Saved Template" tab with selector/save/delete (Story 2.5)
- First-run welcome message on Geography page (Story 2.1)

### Uncommitted Changes
All project code changes above are uncommitted. BMAD tooling updates also uncommitted (`.claude/commands/`, `.gemini/commands/`, `_bmad/` — plugin version changes including testarch/excalidraw removal).

### Remaining Story Gaps (Not Tackled This Session)
- **Story 2.6**: Cross-workflow dedup UI (logic in dedup.py exists, no UI surface)
- **Story 4.1**: Usage Dashboard date range filter on query history table
- **Story 4.2**: `narrative_metric` component (trends exist as Plotly charts, but no narrative text)
- **Story 4.3**: Pipeline Health page (entirely missing — new page needed)

### Test Count
474 tests passing (up from 453)

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Commit all changes** — Project code + BMAD tooling updates
2. **Live test Geography pipeline** — Needs browser interaction (bead HADES-kyi)
3. **Live test full UI** — All 4 pipelines through Streamlit (bead HADES-kbu)
4. **Implement remaining gaps** — Stories 2.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
5. **Configure SMTP secrets** — For email delivery from GitHub Actions

### Beads Status

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 13)

### Planning Artifacts Complete

Completed two BMAD workflows spanning this session and the prior one (which ran out of context):

**Create Epics and Stories** — 4 epics, 18 stories, 22/22 FR coverage:
- Epic 1: Intent Lead Pipeline (6 stories) — end-to-end Intent workflow + shared infrastructure (API client, caching, dedup, export, operators)
- Epic 2: Geography Lead Pipeline (6 stories) — territory search, dual modes (Autopilot/Manual), auto-expansion, saved templates
- Epic 3: Cost Controls & Budget Management (3 stories) — caps, alerts, usage tracking
- Epic 4: Dashboards & Executive Reporting (3 stories) — usage dashboard, executive summary, pipeline health

**Implementation Readiness Check** — 6-step adversarial review:
- Verdict: **READY WITH CONDITIONS**
- 0 critical, 2 major (both in Epic 4 only), 4 minor issues
- Major: Story 4.3 error tracking data source undefined, Story 4.2 "Request Territory Query" CTA vague
- PRD and Architecture are stale relative to UX spec — documentation debt, not planning blockers
- Epic 1 and Epic 2 are clear to start immediately

**NFR-SEC-003 added to Story 1.1** — No PII in error messages/DB records (user pushed back on vague "log entries" wording; reworded to reference actual error surfaces: `st.error()`, PipelineError, `query_history`).

### Key Files Created/Modified (Session 13)

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Session 12)

### Live Pipeline Test + Bug Fix

First live run of the Intent pipeline against real ZoomInfo API. Pipeline completed end-to-end: 25 intent → 8 scored → 3 exported (batch HADES-20260217-001).

**Bug found and fixed:**
- `scoring.py:36` — `managementLevel` returned as list from enrich API, caused `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'` in `get_authority_score()`. Fixed by normalizing to first element. 2 tests added.

### Housekeeping
- Committed 4 lingering files from sessions 6-8: `config/icp.yaml` (automation config), `zoho_sync.py` (ISO timestamp + dedup guard), `pages/3_Operators.py` (st.button), `.streamlit/secrets.toml.template` (SMTP placeholders)
- Fixed `empty_state` rendering raw HTML as text — indented `<p>` tags in triple-quoted string treated as markdown code blocks
- Created GitHub repo: `andre-sav/HADES` (private), pushed all commits
- Set 4 GitHub secrets: TURSO_DATABASE_URL, TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN, ZOOMINFO_CLIENT_ID, ZOOMINFO_CLIENT_SECRET
- Closed beads HADES-1ln (Intent live test), HADES-5c7 (Enrich live test)

### Key Files Modified (Session 12)

## Session Summary (2026-02-17, Sessions 10-11)

### Intent Polling Automation (Full Feature)

Designed, planned, and implemented automated intent lead polling. 6-task TDD plan executed via subagent-driven development with two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) per task.

**Commits:**
- `3854e2b` — `pipeline_runs` table + 3 DB methods + 9 tests
- `0d25203` — Pipeline run logging with status tracking and trigger source
- `c3535c8` — Credentials fallback to `st.secrets` for Run Now button
- `3612af8` — GitHub Actions workflow (`intent-poll.yml`, Mon-Fri 7AM ET, `workflow_dispatch` with dry_run)
- `6bbcee8` — Automation dashboard page (initial build)
- `21e0c54` — CLAUDE.md updated (file structure, 451 tests)

### Design System & UI Critique

- `d4079c8` — Extracted design system from `ui_components.py` into `.interface-design/system.md`. Rebuilt Automation page with custom HTML run cards, budget progress bar, structured config display.
- `bb985da` — Automation config block in `icp.yaml` + SMTP template
- `3fa4a6a` — Zoho sync: ISO timestamp format fix + duplicate name guard
- `c86e220` — Operators page: replaced unreliable `ui.button` with `st.button`
- `76451bf` — Fixed `empty_state` rendering raw HTML (indented tags treated as code blocks by markdown parser)

## Session Summary (2026-02-16, Session 9)

### Staged Exports — Persist Leads for CSV Re-Export

Implemented `staged_exports` table so workflow results survive browser refresh. Users can now re-export past runs without re-running the workflow.

- **turso_db.py** — Added `staged_exports` table to `init_schema()` (auto-creates on app start), plus 4 methods: `save_staged_export()`, `get_staged_exports()`, `get_staged_export()`, `mark_staged_exported()`
- **pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py** — Persist leads to `staged_exports` after scoring, with `intent_leads_staged` rerun guard
- **pages/2_Geography_Workflow.py** — Same pattern with `geo_leads_staged` guard, includes `operator_id`
- **pages/4_CSV_Export.py** — When session state empty, shows staged exports table with Load buttons. Loaded leads populate session state, existing export flow works unchanged. Mark-as-exported updates the staged row.

### Messy Data Hardening (HADES-20n — CLOSED)

Ran comprehensive code exploration across all API boundary code. Found and fixed 4 bugs, added 28 edge case tests.

**Bugs fixed:**
1. **scoring.py:156** — `float("5.0 miles")` crash in geography scoring → try/except + regex digit extraction
2. **scoring.py:350** — `"95%" >= 95` type mismatch in contact scoring → int coercion + regex fallback
3. **utils.py:316** — ZIP+4 with space `"75201 1234"` and 9-digit `"752011234"` → split/truncate to 5 digits
4. **expand_search.py:119** — Mixed int/string company/person IDs → normalize to `str()` for dedup

**28 new tests across:** test_scoring.py (17), test_utils.py (4), test_expand_search.py (4), test_dedup.py (3)

### CLAUDE.md Updated

- Test count 288 → 438
- Documented schema auto-creation pattern and Streamlit rerun guard pattern
- Added ZoomInfo messy data specifics (mixed ID types, string numerics, ZIP+4 variants)
- Reviewed all available skills; identified `/commit`, `/code-review`, `systematic-debugging`, `dispatching-parallel-agents` as most relevant for HADES

## Session Summary (2026-02-12, Session 7)

### Data-Driven Scoring Calibration (Plan Implementation)

Replaced all intuition-based scoring with empirically derived values from 3,136 HLM Locating delivery records:

1. **Created `data/sic_manual_overrides.csv`** — 29 manual SIC classifications for Delivered records with no `vs_sic` match (100% SIC coverage on delivered records)
2. **Created `calibrate_scoring.py`** — Standalone analysis script: reads enriched CSV + overrides, computes per-SIC delivery rates, min-max scales to 20-100 scores, analyzes employee scale
3. **Updated `config/icp.yaml`** — Replaced tier-based `onsite_likelihood` (high=100/medium=70/low=40) with per-SIC score map (16 SICs with 10+ records). Inverted `employee_scale` (50-100emp→100, 501+→20). Added 3 new SIC codes (4213 Trucking, 4581 Aviation, 4731 Freight). Total: 22→25 SICs.
4. **Rewrote `utils.py:get_onsite_likelihood_score()`** — From tier-iteration to single dict lookup against `sic_scores` map
5. **Updated all tests** — New per-SIC score assertions, inverted employee scale, recalculated composite scores

**Key data insights:**
- Hotels (7011) dropped from 100→40 (only 6.8% delivery rate)
- Residential Care (8361) rose to 71 (17.4% rate)
- Aviation Services (4581) top performer at 100 (27.3% rate)
- Small companies (50-100emp) convert at 10% vs large (501+) at 1% — completely inverted from prior assumption

### Full Project Code Review (13 Issues Fixed)

Ran comprehensive code review, identified and fixed all 13 issues:

**Critical (2):**
- DataFrame index mismatch in Intent/Geography workflows — added `_idx` column for safe filtered-row mapping
- Parameter mutation in ZoomInfo pagination — added `dataclasses.replace()` copies in all 3 methods

**High (4):**
- Redundant `(ValueError, Exception)` catch → simplified to `Exception` in turso_db.py
- `execute_many` replay risk — added rollback + docstring explaining reconnect safety
- CLAUDE.md stale "22 SIC codes" → updated to 25 in 3 locations
- Mobile phone unformatted in export — added `format_phone()` call

**Medium (7):**
- Hardcoded SIC sets in calibration script → reads from icp.yaml via `load_icp_sics()`
- `lru_cache` on `load_config()` prevents hot-reload → added docstring note
- Missing combined search integration tests → added 2 tests
- Hardcoded proximity default 70 → config-driven `get_proximity_score(15.0)`
- `_last_auth_response` not initialized in `__init__` → added
- Budget alert scale inconsistency → normalized to `threshold_percent`
- Missing enrich response format tests → added 2 tests for uncovered paths

## Session Summary (2026-02-13, Session 8)

### Intent Workflow Findings Fix (6 of 9 issues, P0-P2)

Implemented fixes for 9 issues found during manual testing of the Intent Workflow (documented in `docs/testing/2026-02-12-intent-workflow-findings.md`). P3 issues deferred.

1. **P0 — Deduplicate contacts by personId** — Added `seen_person_ids` set in `_search_contacts_single_batch()` to filter duplicates during pagination. Added defensive dedup in `build_contacts_by_company()`. Both layers with tests.
2. **P1 — Use numeric signalScore for intent scoring** — `calculate_intent_score()` now prefers numeric `signalScore` (0-100) over categorical `intentStrength` bucket. Added `audienceStrength` bonus (0-10 pts) and employee scale bonus (0-5 pts) as tiebreakers. 4 new tests.
3. **P1 — Fix Companies metric in Results** — Shows "4 of 7" (contacts found vs selected) instead of just the selected count.
4. **P2 — Show zero-contact explanation** — After contact search, shows caption explaining missing companies.
5. **P2 — Collapse completed steps** — When results showing, Step 1 form + debug panel hidden, replaced with collapsed pipeline summary expander.
6. **P1 — Hide City/State columns in test mode** — City/State excluded from results table in test mode with explanatory caption.

**Deferred (P3):** #8 Search button stays accessible, #9 Intent signal filtering limited.

### Brainstorming Session Started

Began BMAD brainstorming session on maximizing lead quantity AND quality. AI-recommended techniques: Morphological Analysis → Cross-Pollination → Reverse Brainstorming. Paused during Phase 1 (parameter grid building).

### Data-Driven Scoring Calibration (Plan Implementation)

(Moved from top-level — see below)

---

## Session Summary (2026-02-11, Session 6)

### Visual UX Audit & Fixes (10 issues)

Chrome MCP working — performed visual audit of all 6 pages + home. Identified 10 cross-cutting UX issues and fixed all of them:

1. **White metric cards** — Replaced all `ui.metric_card()` (shadcn iframe, white bg) with custom `metric_card()` across 7 files
2. **Chart theming** — Executive Summary Plotly charts: per-workflow colors (indigo=Intent, cyan=Geography), transparent bg, dotted gridlines, Urbanist font
3. **Table styling** — Added `styled_table()` helper with alternating rows, hover, monospace numbers, status pills. Updated home page and Export tables
4. **Empty states** — Improved Export empty state, Usage weekly context caption, Geography operator count hint
5. **Button hierarchy** — Verified CSS already correct, no changes needed
6. **Font loading** — Verified Urbanist + IBM Plex Mono loading correctly via Chrome JS
7. **Sidebar icons** — CSS pseudo-elements for sidebar nav items
8. **Color palette** — Progress bar success color changed from green to indigo→cyan gradient
9. **Loading states** — Consolidated shimmer keyframe to global CSS
10. **Information density** — Operators pagination (20/page), card-style home quick actions, styled Executive Summary table

### CodeRabbit Review & Fixes (6 applied)

Ran full project review. Applied 6 fixes:
- Bare `except:pass` → logs error with `st.caption()` (Intent workflow)
- SQLite parameter limit → batches `IN` clause to 900 params (turso_db.py)
- Missing delete error handling → try/except with `st.error()` (Operators)
- `ui.button()` None guard → `bool()` wrapper (ui_components.py)
- Unreachable geo "selecting" state → changed key from `geo_contacts_by_company` to `geo_preview_contacts`
- "Coffee services" → "Coffee Services" (icp.yaml)

### Outcome-Driven Scoring Design

Brainstormed and designed a feedback loop system for data-calibrated lead scoring:
- **Batch ID tracking**: HADES export → VanillaSoft "Import Notes" → Zoho CRM custom field
- **Outcome tables**: `historical_outcomes` (3,000+ existing leads) + `lead_outcomes` (ongoing)
- **Historical bootstrap**: Import 319 delivery records + 3,000+ total VanillaSoft-sourced leads from Zoho
- **Calibration engine**: Conversion rates by SIC code, employee range, proximity, state → replace hardcoded weights
- **Score Calibration page**: Review suggested vs current weights, approve before applying
- **Future path**: Graduate to logistic regression at 500+ HADES-originated outcomes
- Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-11-outcome-driven-scoring-design.md`

## Session Summary (2026-02-11, Session 5)

### CSS Theme Overhaul (Priority 1 — "Mission Control" aesthetic)

**Design assessment** performed across all 6 pages and `ui_components.py` (1,711 lines). Identified 10 pain points: visual fragmentation (3 competing styling systems), default typography, no motion/transitions, unpolished native widgets, passive home page.

**Implemented:**
1. **Google Fonts** — Urbanist (display/body) + IBM Plex Mono (data values) loaded via `<link>` tag
2. **Global font override** — CSS selectors for all Streamlit elements: headings, inputs, labels, tabs, sidebar, captions, metrics
3. **Monospace data values** — IBM Plex Mono with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on all metric cards, summary strips, deltas, pagination
4. **Input labels** — uppercase, letter-spaced, smaller text ("Mission Control" console feel)
5. **Primary buttons** — indigo→cyan gradient, hover glow (`box-shadow`), press scale (`transform: scale(0.98)`)
6. **Secondary buttons** — indigo border + text highlight on hover
7. **Input focus states** — primary color border + 2px glow ring
8. **Dataframe** — rounded corners, consistent border
9. **Expander** — card-like background, hover border
10. **Sidebar** — active page indigo left-border indicator, hover background
11. **Dividers** — gradient fade (transparent→border→transparent) replacing hard `<hr>` lines
12. **Metric cards** — 2px gradient accent line at top, box-shadow elevation, hover lift
13. **Step indicator** — active step gets gradient + glow; completed connectors use gradient
14. **Contact cards** — selection glow ring, hover shadow
15. **Scrollbar** — 6px thin dark scrollbar
16. **Background** — subtle radial vignette with primary/accent color tints
17. **Page load animation** — 300ms fade-in-up (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
18. **Color refinement** — deeper backgrounds (`#0a0e14`, `#141922`), subtler borders, softer text white
19. **Accent color family** — cyan (#06b6d4) added for gradient endpoints
20. **CSS custom properties** — `--accent-gradient`, `--card-shadow`, `--radius`, `--transition` for consistency

### Chrome Extension Debugging
- Diagnosed competing native messaging hosts (Claude Desktop + Claude Code both claim extension ID `fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn`)
- Renamed Desktop host to `.bak` — extension still not connecting
- Native host binary verified working (creates socket at `/tmp/claude-mcp-browser-bridge-boss/`)
- Likely needs extension reload at `chrome://extensions` or full reinstall

### Key Files Modified
```
ui_components.py          - FONTS dict, accent colors, deepened palette, full inject_base_styles() rewrite (+770 lines of CSS)
.streamlit/config.toml    - Updated background/text colors, removed invalid color options
docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md   - This update
```

### Uncommitted Changes
All changes from sessions 1-5 remain uncommitted (22 modified + 9 untracked files, +3052/-666 lines). Theme overhaul needs visual verification before committing.

### What Needs Doing Next Session
1. **Visual verification** — Get Chrome extension working or manually open localhost:8502 and review all 6 pages
2. **Priority 2: Home page redesign** — Active dashboard with pipeline status, next actions
3. **Priority 3: Table styling** — Inline score bars, row emphasis, better column formatting
4. **Priority 4: Page load animations** — Staggered fade-in for cards and sections
5. **Priority 5: Standardize headers/action bars** across all 6 pages
6. **Live test all pipelines** — Intent, Geography, Enrich, Export (beads HADES-1ln through HADES-kbu)

## Session Summary (2026-02-10, Session 4)

### Intent Pipeline Debugging (6 cascading bugs fixed)
1. **`sicCodes` array vs string** — Streamlit cached old code; restart fixed
2. **Invalid topic "Vending"** — Queried `/lookup/intent/topics`, found correct name "Vending Machines". Updated `config/icp.yaml` and default in UI
3. **Hashed companyId** — Intent API returns hashed IDs incompatible with Contact Search. Built two-phase pipeline: enrich 1 recommended contact → get numeric ID → cache → Contact Search
4. **Date parsing** — Legacy API returns `"1/24/2026 12:00 AM"` format. Added US date parsing branch to `_calculate_age_days()`
5. **Nested company object** — API returns `company.name` not `companyName`. Updated normalization to check nested `company` object
6. **Null field fallback bug** — `dict.get("intentDate", fallback)` returns `None` when key exists with null value. Changed all fallbacks to `or` pattern: `item.get("intentDate") or item.get("signalDate", "")`

### Two-Phase Contact Pipeline
- Phase 1: Resolve hashed company IDs via Turso cache or enrich 1 recommended contact
- Phase 2: Contact Search with full ICP filters (Manager level, 95+ accuracy, phone required)
- Company ID mapping cached in Turso `company_id_mapping` table

### UI Improvements
- Full-width layout (removed `max-width: 1200px` constraint)
- Editable Contact Search filters in Filters expander (management level, accuracy, phone fields)
- Step 2 table cleaned: removed empty columns (City, State, Employees), added Age column
- Raw API response display in API Request/Response expander for debugging
- Intent search credits set to 0 (search is free)

### Code Review
- Ran 5 parallel review agents, found 2 actionable issues
- Fixed: outdated pipeline comment, added 3 US date format tests

### Key Files Modified
```
config/icp.yaml                - Real ZoomInfo intent topics
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py     - Two-phase pipeline, editable filters, table cleanup, raw API display
scoring.py                     - US date format parsing in _calculate_age_days()
turso_db.py                    - company_id_mapping table and CRUD methods
zoominfo_client.py             - Nested company object normalization, null field fallbacks, raw key capture
ui_components.py               - Full-width layout (max-width: 100%)
tests/test_scoring.py          - 3 US date format tests
tests/test_zoominfo_client.py  - 2 tests (nested company, null fallback)
.claude/commands/              - Copied skills from .claude/skills/ to correct location
```

### Uncommitted Changes
All changes from sessions 1-4 remain uncommitted (22 modified + 9 untracked files, +2531/-594 lines). Intent pipeline needs live verification before committing.

### What Needs Live Testing Next Session
- **Re-run intent search** after null fallback fix — should now show company names and proper scoring
- Verify two-phase pipeline: resolve IDs → Contact Search → Enrich → Export
- Confirm editable filters flow through to Contact Search params

## Session Summary (2026-02-10, Session 3)

### Insights-Driven Improvements
- Reviewed `/insights` report (177 sessions, 227 commits analyzed)
- Created **global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`** with behavioral rules: root-cause debugging, efficient planning, messy data handling, schema consistency, start-work-immediately
- Added **project-specific sections** to `HADES/CLAUDE.md`: Testing, External APIs (Zoho + ZoomInfo)
- Created **`/session-close` skill** (`.claude/skills/session-close.md`) — one-command session close protocol
- Created **`/session-start` skill** (`.claude/skills/session-start.md`) — one-command session start protocol
- Added **pre-commit test hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) — runs full pytest suite before every commit, blocks on failure (~1.4s)
- Created beads: HADES-20n (harden API edge cases), HADES-kbu (live test all pipelines)

### Key Files Modified/Created
```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md                    - NEW: global behavioral rules
CLAUDE.md                              - Added Testing + External APIs sections

.git/hooks/pre-commit                  - Added pytest gate before beads hook
```

### Uncommitted Changes
All changes from sessions 1-3 remain uncommitted (16 modified + 7 untracked files, +2196/-523 lines). No commit made this session — work was tooling/config focused.

## Session Summary (2026-02-10, Session 2)

### Turso Stale Connection Fix
- `turso_db.py`: Added `_reconnect()` and `_is_stale_stream_error()` to `TursoDatabase`
- `execute()`, `execute_write()`, `execute_many()` all auto-reconnect on "stream not found" 404 errors
- Root cause: Turso closes idle Hrana streams server-side; cached connection goes stale

### ZoomInfo Token Persistence
- `zoominfo_client.py`: Added `_load_persisted_token()` and `_persist_token()` to `ZoomInfoClient`
- Token stored in Turso `sync_metadata` table (key: `zoominfo_token`, value: JSON with jwt + expires_at)
- `_get_token()` flow: check in-memory → check DB → call `/authenticate`
- Prevents auth rate limits on Streamlit restarts

### Intent Search: Legacy API Migration
- **Problem**: v2 endpoint `/gtm/data/v1/intent/search` requires OAuth2 PKCE tokens (scope `api:data:intent`), incompatible with legacy JWT from `/authenticate`
- **Fix**: Switched to legacy `/search/intent` endpoint which works with JWT auth
- Legacy endpoint supports ICP filters: `employeeRangeMin` (string), `sicCodes` (comma-separated string)
- Response normalization handles both legacy field names (`companyId`, `intentStrength`) and fallbacks
- All 5 intent search tests updated for legacy format

### Auth Error Guard
- `_authenticate()` now raises `ZoomInfoAuthError` if response is 200 but JWT is missing
- Previously silently set `access_token = None`, causing all subsequent API calls to fail with 401

### API Debug Panel (Intent Workflow)
- Shows full request: method, URL, query params, request body
- Shows full response: HTTP status, headers (checkbox toggle), response body as JSON
- Shows errors: message, attempt count, auth response body when relevant
- `ZoomInfoClient.last_exchange` captures every HTTP request/response for debugging
- Auto-expands on error for immediate visibility

### Key Files Modified

```
turso_db.py                   - Stale stream reconnect logic
zoominfo_client.py            - Token persistence, legacy intent endpoint, last_exchange debug, auth guard
pages/1_Intent_Workflow.py    - API debug panel (request/response/error display)
tests/test_zoominfo_client.py - 5 intent tests updated for legacy format
```

## Chrome Extension Fix

Claude Desktop's native host was renamed to `.bak`:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_browser_extension.json.bak
```
To restore: rename back (remove `.bak`). Extension still not connecting after rename — try reloading extension at `chrome://extensions` or reinstalling.

## Commands

```bash
streamlit run app.py          # Run app (currently running on port 8502)
python -m pytest tests/ -v    # Run tests (296 passing)
bd ready                      # See available work
bd list                       # All issues
python calibrate_scoring.py   # Re-run calibration analysis
```
